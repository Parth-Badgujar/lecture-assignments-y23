#Assignmets

I hope you are enjoying your journey of learning Machine Learning. You must have learnt a lot of stuff in the lectures and I am sure you must have explored even more on your own, now it is time to apply the skills you have acquired.

It is time for your first assignment on ML :

The assignment has been divided into 3 parts and you are expected to:
Complete atleast one part by 21st
Complete atleast two parts by 25th
Complete the entire assignment by 28th (this is a hard deadline, please note that)
NB: Completion means getting it verified by a senior
Do not start the assignment a day before the deadline, the questions require some pondering and in order to truly enjoy and take the most out of the questions you ought to give them significant time.
Lastly, I hope you enjoy your holidays and have fun!!!!
(Feel free to drop any random doubts you have on the channel or you can use Slack to personally message any senior)
